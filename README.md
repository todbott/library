# MyReads Project

This is the MyReads project for Udacity!  Since I work full time and am trying to finish the nanodegree here within 2 months, I didn't add to/improve any of the code here, and I used the starter template as-is from Udacity.

## Installation

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Details

From the main page of the app, you can shuffle the books that you've read, want to read, and are currently reading from shelf to shelf by clicking the green down arrow icon displayed with each book, and toggling the state.  Selecting "None" as the shelf to which to move the book will result in the book being deleted from your bookshelf.

If you want to search for more books to add, simply click the green plus icon in the lower right.  This will take you to the book search page (/search), where you can search for books.  If any of the books that are returned in your search results already exist in your bookshelves, you will be able to see that they have information regarding which shelf they are currently on.  In addition to moving your books around in your bookshelves on the main page, you can also do so here, by clicking on the green down arrow icon displayed with the book and changing the shelf designation.

Books that are not on your shelves (in the search results) are automatically assigned a shelf of "None".  If you want to move a book to your shelves (from the search results), simply click on the green down arrow displayed next to the book and assign it to the shelf you want.

Pressing the back arrow at the upper left will return you to your 'bookshelf view'.  There, you will be able to see your books again, in their three categories, plus any books that you added to any shelves while you were in the search view.
